# Whiteboarding
- Slow down, write concise code.
- After you've finished, take time to double-check your work
  - Mentally run through the problem with real data.
  - Try odd cases, and see what happens
    - If you have time, write a quick unit test
- Practice whiteboarding at home.
  - Especially prior to going in for the interview itself
  - *When you think you’re done, take your code and see if it actually runs. Learn from what didn’t work.*
- "it is hard to differentiate between someone who can’t code very well at all, and someone who just can’t code well on the whiteboard"
