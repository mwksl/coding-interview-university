## Whiteboarding
- Slow down, write concise code.
- After you've finished, take time to double-check your work
  - Mentally run through the problem with real data.
  - Try odd cases, and see what happens
    - If you have time, write a quick unit test
- Practice whiteboarding at home.
  - Especially prior to going in for the interview itself
  - *When you think you’re done, take your code and see if it actually runs. Learn from what didn’t work.*
- "it is hard to differentiate between someone who can’t code very well at all, and someone who just can’t code well on the whiteboard"

## Recruiting
- Recruiting isn't a black box
  - it isn't serendipitous
- Most important question?
  - Are you passionate about your work?
    - Share your work!
  - Github, other open source
  - published work
  - social media
  - meetups

     * an engineer screens you
     * get a good idea of your fitness
     * often given prep material
  3. Onsite Interview
     * Meeting with multiple engineers
       * It's a two-way street, find what really matters
     * Lunch is a good time to get a feel for the personal questions
     * Most code is done on the whiteboard
       * Checking to see if you're capable of building from scratch
  4. Interview debrief
     * All interviewers meet together and discuss
       * Intended to balance out different interviews
  5. Candidate review
     * An objective review of all the feedback on the candidate
       * Not just from engineers
  6. Offer
